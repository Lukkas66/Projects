            <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>

                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best—and most grueling—time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
                learning from their experiences was easy.</p>

                <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
                    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
